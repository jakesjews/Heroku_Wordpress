Heroku_Wordpress
================

Just download the script file, make it executable with chmod +x and run it to create a wordpress site hosted on Heroku
which uses cleardb. This script requires that the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) is installed 
and has only been tested on OS X.
